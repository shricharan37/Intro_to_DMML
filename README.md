# Introduction to Data Mining and Machine Learning for Bioinformatics

Welcome to the repository for the course "Introduction to Data Mining and Machine Learning for Bioinformatics". This repository contains exercises that were handled as part of the course during my 7th semester in SASTRA

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into 10 sub-repositories, each corresponding to a specific exercise. Each sub-repository contains:
- An '.ipynb' file for the exercise.
- A manual file, which may be in '.docx' or '.pdf' format.
- Some sub-repositories may also include the dataset used in the exercise.


### Usage Instructions

To use the .ipynb files, follow these steps:

#### Google Colab

1. Download the '.ipynb' file of the exercise you want to work on.
2. Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Click on 'File' -> 'Upload Notebook'.
4. Choose the downloaded '.ipynb' file and upload it.
5. The notebook will open in Google Colab, where you can run and edit it.
